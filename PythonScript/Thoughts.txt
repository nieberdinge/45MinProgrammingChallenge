Thoughts on PythonScript
I think that this was very rewarding.\nI love effiecncy and this makes the process a little bit more efficent.\nI think overall this program is pretty good.
What I learned:
I learned a lot about moving files around using the os and shutil libraries.\nThis was also a good refresher on how python writes.\nI used python in my freshman year and coming back to it with my new knowledge is rewarding.
What I would do if I had more time
I would make it more universal.\nRight now it only works on my machine.\nI would better format the program.
