Description of PythonScript
This is a script that writes the Thoughts.txt and gathers all the files into a folder on your desktop.
I am writing this Thought.txt using the script!

Thoughts on PythonScript
I think that this was very rewarding.
I love effiecncy and this makes the process a little bit more efficent.
I think overall this program is pretty good.

What I learned:
I learned a lot about moving files around using the os and shutil libraries.
This was also a good refresher on how python writes.
I used python in my freshman year and coming back to it with my new knowledge is rewarding.

What I would do if I had more time
I would make it more universal.
Right now it only works on my machine.
I would better format the program.
